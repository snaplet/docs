## v0.98.0 - 30 Jul 2024

### Breaking changes ðŸš¨
There is no more backend when using Snaplet seed. This means that some features will also be affected
1. To make use of the AI data generated feature you will have to add your own OpenAI or Groq key see [README](https://github.com/snaplet/seed/blob/main/packages/seed/README.md#L55-L84)
2. For fields with unique constraints (example email) will currently default to `copycat.sentence` since we don't have our custom model to identify the shape anymore. For these cases please define it in manually as in this example in the docs:
```
await seed.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    author: {
      email: (ctx) =>
        copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
    comments: (x) => x(3),
  },
]);
```
3. Older CLI clients will stop working on the 31st Aug 2024 since it relies on the backend API.

### New Features ðŸŽ‰
* Snaplet can be used fully offline and is completely open source so bring your suggestion and make contributions.
