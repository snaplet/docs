# Prisma

> Take a look at the [quick start](https://docs.snaplet.dev/getting-started/quick-start/seed) guide on Seed for a general introduction to the command.

Prisma Migrations creates the database structure, Snaplet seed requires to generate data against.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
prisma migrate dev && npx tsx seed.mts
```

If you don't want to run two commands, you can automatically seed the database with data, after running `prisma migrate reset` or `prisma migrate dev`, by adding the following to your `package.json` file.

```json package.json
"prisma": {
  "seed": "npx tsx seed.mts"
}
```

Learn ["how to seed your database in Prisma"](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/seed-database#how-to-seed-your-database-in-prisma) from their documentation.

## Note on Migrations

Whenever your database structure changes (e.g after a new migration is applied), `@snaplet/seed` will need be regenerated to reflect the new structure. To do this, run the following command:
```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx snaplet generate
```
