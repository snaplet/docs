# Seed Quick Start Guide

## Assumptions

This guide will take you through the process of using `@snaplet/seed` to create realistic, production-like data.

<Callout emoji="📁">
  If you already have access to a database with production or production-like
  data you'd prefer to use as a source, you should instead follow the [Snapshot
  Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/snapshot) guide.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- You'll need to have the [Snaplet CLI](/getting-started/installation) installed and have run `snaplet setup`
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- a PostgreSQL database server running

CREATE TABLE public.post (

  title text NOT NULL,
  content text NOT NULL,
  author_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.user(id)
);
CREATE TABLE public.comment (
  id uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,

);
```

The diagram above represents the relationships of your database.

From the SQL tab above, copy the SQL statement and insert this into your database to define your schema.

## Snaplet seed

We've now got a new database and a schema that lays out the structure of your data, but no actual data. This is where we can now use Snaplet to seed your database with production-like data.

For your example blog application, let's assume we need the following data:

- A post titled "Hello World!"
- A post author, with an email address that ends with "acme.org."
- Three comments on the post.

It's worth noting what we're not explicitly defining - that each comment needs to have a separate, unique author, for instance. We're assuming that `@snaplet/seed` will fill in the blanks based on your schema and seed realistic data as needed.

### Describing your requirements

In order to have Snaplet seed this data for your blog, we need to describe these requirements to `@snaplet/seed`.

<CH.Scrollycoding className="seed-tutorial-configuration-file">

First, we need to create a new seed script file that imports `@snaplet/seed`.

This can be any javascript file that can be run by Node.js, but we recommend creating a typescript file for the best developer experience.

- If you chose to have Snaplet seed an example for you during `snaplet setup`, you should have `seed.mts` file in your project that looks something like the code below.
- If you chose to not have Snaplet seed an example, create a `seed.mts` file in your project (the directory where you ran `snaplet setup`) that looks like this:

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient();
```

---

`snaplet` in the code above exposes all your models (i.e. your database tables, or the entities in your application - in this case "user" and "post") as functions.

During `snaplet setup`, Snaplet would have read your database structure (using the database connection string you entered), and used this to create these functions.

These functions return what we call a _plan_. When describing a plan, you always start from a "root" model - a model where we would start describing how to seed seed data, along with data for its related models (more on this soon).

Here we start from the `posts` models. `await`ing a plan will execute it.

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient();

// focus
await snaplet.posts([{}]);
```

---

You can directly define the values of your model.

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient();

await snaplet.posts([
  {
    // focus
    title: 'Hello World!',
  },
]);
```

---

You can also define the values of your model's relationships.
Here we define the author of the post represented by the `author` field.

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient();

await snaplet.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    // focus(1:6)
    author: {
      email: ({ seed }) =>
        copycat.email(seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
  },
]);
```

---

Next, we also define the comments of the post represented by the `comments` field.
As we need more than one comment, we can use the `x` function which will create a list of similar comments.
You can read it as "comments times 3".

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient();

await snaplet.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    author: {
      email: ({ seed }) =>
        copycat.email(seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
    // focus
    comments: (x) => x(3),
  },
]);
```

---

Finally, we'll add a `dryRun` option when instantiating `SnapletClient`. When we run our script with a `DRY` environment variable set, we'll log the sql statements
to the console instead altering the database.

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient({
  // focus
  dryRun: process.env.DRY === '1'
});

await snaplet.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    author: {
      email: ({ seed }) =>
        copycat.email(seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
    comments: (x) => x(3),
  },
]);
```

---

We're done!

Copy the code and add it to your `seed.mts` file.

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient({
  dryRun: process.env.DRY === '1'
});

await snaplet.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    author: {
      email: ({ seed }) =>
        copycat.email(seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
    comments: (x) => x(3),
  },
]);
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

### Executing the plan

At this point, you're ready to run your seed script for the first time!

Let's see what statements are generated by using the `DRY` environment variable we defined.

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
DRY=1 npx tsx seed.mts
```

You should see the following output:

Click the '**Next**' button on the slider above to see a step-by-step explanation of this output.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal
INSERT INTO public.user (email,id,username) VALUES

```

---

This is the post, titled "Hello World!" as intended.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=8

```

---

This is the author of the post, notice the "acme.org" in the email.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=2

```

---

And here are the 3 comments.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=11:13

```

---

As mentioned earlier, these 3 users were automatically generated to satisfy the requirement of 3 comments. You didn't need to define them - `@snaplet/seed` did it for you, because it knows your schema relationships and can fulfill them automatically.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=3:5

```

</CH.Slideshow>

It's now time to seed this data into your database.

In order to do that, run this command in your terminal (notice how the `DRY` environment variable is missing):

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx tsx seed.mts
```

All done, you're now ready to code against your generated data!
