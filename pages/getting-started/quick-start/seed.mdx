# Seed Quick Start Guide

## Assumptions

This guide will take you through the process of using `@snaplet/seed` to create realistic, production-like data.

<Callout emoji="📁">
  If you already have access to a database with production or production-like
  data you'd prefer to use as a source, you should instead follow the [Snapshot
  Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/snapshot) guide.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- a PostgreSQL database server running

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.user (
  id uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  username text NOT NULL,
  email text NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE public.post (
  id uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  title text NOT NULL,
  content text NOT NULL,
  author_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.user(id)
);
CREATE TABLE public.comment (
  id uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  content text NOT NULL,
  author_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.user(id),
  post_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.post(id),
  written_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

The diagram above represents the relationships of your database.

From the SQL tab above, copy the SQL statement and insert this into your database to define your schema.

## Setting up snaplet

We now need to add snaplet to your project.

Run the following in your project root directory and follow the interactive prompts:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx snaplet setup
```

## `@snaplet/seed`

### Describing your requirements

We now have a database with structure in it, and Snaplet set up to use it. We still do not yet have data though.
In order to have Snaplet generate this data, you'll need to tell Snaplet _how_ to generate the data.

This is where `@snaplet/seed` comes in: it gives you a programmatic interface to describe your seeding requirements.

<CH.Scrollycoding className="seed-tutorial-seed-script">

`snaplet setup` would have generated an example script file called `seed.mts` in your project, which imports and
uses `@snaplet/seed`. It should look something like this:

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient();
```

---

For your example blog application, let's assume we need the following data:

- A post titled "Hello World!"
- A post author, with an email address that ends with "acme.org."
- Three comments on the post.

It's worth noting what we're not explicitly defining - that each comment needs to have a separate, unique author, for instance. We're assuming that `@snaplet/seed` will fill in the blanks based on your schema and seed realistic data as needed.

`snaplet` in the code above exposes all your models (i.e. your database tables, or the entities in your application - in this case "user" and "post") as functions.

During `snaplet setup`, Snaplet would have read your database structure (using the database connection string you entered), and used this to create these functions.

These functions return what we call a _plan_. When describing a plan, you always start from a "root" model - a model where we would start describing how to seed seed data, along with data for its related models (more on this soon).

Here we start from the `posts` models. `await`ing a plan will execute it.

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient();

// focus
await seed.posts([{}]);
```

---

You can directly define the values of your model.

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient();

await seed.posts([
  {
    // focus
    title: 'Hello World!',
  },
]);
```

---

You can also define the values of your model's relationships.
Here we define the author of the post represented by the `author` field.

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient();

await seed.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    // focus(1:6)
    author: {
      email: (ctx) =>
        copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
  },
]);
```

---

Next, we also define the comments of the post represented by the `comments` field.
As we need more than one comment, we can use the `x` function which will create a list of similar comments.
You can read it as "comments times 3".

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient();

await seed.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    author: {
      email: (ctx) =>
        copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
    // focus
    comments: (x) => x(3),
  },
]);
```

---

Finally:
* We'll add a `dryRun` option when creating `SeedClient` - in dry run mode, we'll log the sql statements to the console instead of altering the database.
* and a `$resetDatabase()` call - this will clear the database of any current data, but keep the structure around

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient({
  // focus
  dryRun: process.env.DRY !== '0'
});

// focus
await seed.$resetDatabase()

await seed.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    author: {
      email: (ctx) =>
        copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
    comments: (x) => x(3),
  },
]);
```

---

We're done!

Copy the code and add it to your `seed.mts` file.

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient({
  dryRun: process.env.DRY !== '0'
});

await seed.$resetDatabase()

await seed.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    author: {
      email: (ctx) =>
        copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
    comments: (x) => x(3),
  },
]);
```

### Executing the plan

At this point, you're ready to run your seed script for the first time!

Let's see what statements are generated by using the `DRY` environment variable we defined.

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx tsx seed.mts
```

You should see the following output:

<CH.Slideshow className="seed-tutorial-sql-output">

Click the '**Next**' button on the slider above to see a step-by-step explanation of this output.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal
INSERT INTO public.user (email,id,username) VALUES
('Craig.Bednar82365@acme.org', '24058b0d-21ec-54b8-a3fa-b0ad8034f10f', 'site-glance56860'),

INSERT INTO public.post (title,content,author_id,id) VALUES

```

---

This is the post, titled "Hello World!" as intended.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=8

```

---

This is the author of the post, notice the "acme.org" in the email.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=2

```

---

And here are the 3 comments.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=11:13

```

---

As mentioned earlier, these 3 users were automatically generated to satisfy the requirement of 3 comments. You didn't need to define them - `@snaplet/seed` did it for you, because it knows your schema relationships and can fulfill them automatically.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=3:5

```

</CH.Slideshow>

It's now time to seed this data into your database.

In order to do that, run this command in your terminal (notice how the `DRY` environment variable is set to `0`):

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
DRY=0 npx tsx seed.mts
```

All done, you're now ready to code against your generated data!

### Evolving your application

Whenever your database structure changes, `@snaplet/seed` will need to be re-generated so that it is in sync with your new database structure.

You can do this by running:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx snaplet generate
```

If you are familiar with [`@prisma/client`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client), you can think of `snaplet generate` doing the same thing, just in this case for `@snaplet/seed` rather than `@prisma/client`.
