# Seed data

## The need for generated data

Generated data, or seed data, is a useful tool in software development, providing an initial set of data for your database.

Here's why it's beneficial:

- **Development:** Provides a consistent dataset for developers.
- **Testing:** Ensures predictability when verifying features.
- **Demonstration:** Showcases your software's abilities with example content.
- **Default Data:** Adds necessary built-ins, like country lists.
- **Onboarding:** Gives new users a filled-out starting point.
- **Performance:** Helps simulate heavy usage scenarios.
- **Guides:** Common reference in tutorials.

While generated data might be the unsung hero of early development, it can get a bit needy as software evolves. But don't sweat it! Our mission is to save you from the never-ending saga of maintaining those seed scripts. Who has time for that, right?

## The workflow at a glance

Using Snaplet to seed data will typically look something like this:

1. Initial setup with `npx @snaplet/seed init`
2. Using `@snaplet/seed` to generate seed data
3. Regenerating assets as your database changes with `npx @snaplet/seed sync`

You can also refer to the [Seed Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start/seed) for a practical example of the workflow.

### 1. Initial setup with `npx @snaplet/seed init`

At the start, you'll setup Snaplet for your project with `npx @snaplet/seed init`, and follow the
interactive prompts.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed init

`@snaplet/seed init` will look at your database and its structure, and use it to generate the configuration files and assets needed by `@snaplet/seed`.

### 2. Using `@snaplet/seed` to generate seed data

`@snaplet/seed` is what you'll use to _actually_ generate data. It is a javascript library, giving you a fully-typed programmatic interface tailored to your database structure, which you'll use to describe _how_ data should be generated.

Most commonly you'll write and run seed scripts that use `@snaplet/seed`. If you write your seed scripts in typescript, [tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) might come in handy for running your scripts:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx tsx seed.mts
```

Writing and running vanilla javascript works too:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
# a vanilla javascript file that uses `@snaplet/seed`
node seed.js
```

You can also use `@snaplet/seed` in other scenarios - for example, in your tests.

For more detail on using `@snaplet/seed`, check out [Generating data with `@snaplet/seed`](#generating-data-with-snapletseed) below.

### 3. Regenerating assets as your database changes with `npx @snaplet/seed sync`

`@snaplet/seed` provides you with a client library that corresponds to your database structure. To do this, snaplet looks at your database structure and uses this to generate assets that `@snaplet/seed` can use to provide this client library.

Whenever your database structure changes, `@snaplet/seed` will need these assets to be regenerated so that they are in sync with your new database structure.

You can regenerate these assets by running:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed sync
```

## Generating data with `@snaplet/seed`

You can refer to the [Seed Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start/seed) to learn about the basics of `@snaplet/seed`.

### Inside the `@snaplet/seed` workflow

#### Plans, stores and SQL statements

The **plan** is what's returned by the functions of `@snaplet/seed`. It's a representation of the data you want to seed.

```ts
const userPlan = seed.users([{ email: 'snappy@snaplet.dev' }]);
//    ^ the plan               ^ the plan's inputs
```

When a plan is executed, triggered by `await`ing the plan, it stores the generated data in an in-memory object called a **store**.
Each plan has its own store.
Then, the store is turned into **SQL statements** that are executed to persist the data in your database.

Given the plan from the [Seed Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start/seed):

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient();

const postsStore = await seed.posts([{
  title: 'Hello World!',
  author: {
    email: (ctx) =>
      copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
        domain: 'acme.org',
      }),
  },
  comments: (x) => x(3),
}]);
```

Here is what its store looks like internally:

```ts
const postsStore = {
  users: [user, user, user, user],
  posts: [post],
  comments: [comment, comment, comment],
}
```

#### The global store

The global store is a special store which contains all the data that was generated as part of the plans you executed.
It is accessible under the `$store` property of the seed client.

```ts
await seed.posts(x => x(3));

// { posts: [post, post, post], users: [user, user, user] }
console.log(seed.$store);
```

#### Local stores

Each plan produces its own store and returns it when executed.
It's particularly useful for the [`connect` option](/core-concepts/seed#using-connect-option).

```ts
const postsStore = await seed.posts(x => x(3));

// { posts: [post, post, post], users: [user, user, user] }
console.log(postsStore);

const usersStore = await seed.users(x => x(2));

// { users: [user, user] }
console.log(usersStore);

// { posts: [post, post, post], users: [user, user, user, user, user] }
console.log(seed.$store);
```

#### Client state

The `SeedClient` keeps track of what was created before with `seed.$store` and increments global seeds each time you call a model function.

If you want to reset this state, you can use the `seed.$reset` function.

```ts
await seed.posts(x => x(3));
seed.$reset();
// will give you the same result as before
await seed.posts(x => x(3));
```

We also provide a way to get a new instance of the `SeedClient` with a clean state through the `seed.$transaction` function.

```ts
await seed.posts(x => x(3));
await seed.$transaction((seed) => {
  // will give you the same result as above
  await seed.posts(x => x(3));
})
```

The `seed.$transaction` function can be used in tests to ensure that each test is executed with a clean state.

If you need a fully deterministic plan execution, you can provide your own seed which will override the global seed counter.

```ts
// These statements will produce the exact same results
await seed.posts(x => x(3), { seed: '42' });
await seed.posts(x => x(3), { seed: '42' })
```

### Static or dynamic data, we got you covered

If you want to use static data, you can directly pass an array to the models functions.
As always, all the required fields and relationships will be automatically created for you based on your database schema.

```ts
// an array of 2 users
seed.users([
  { email: 'alice@acme.com' },
  { email: 'bob@acme.com' },
]);
```

If you want to use dynamic data, you can pass a callback function to the models functions. We inject a function `x` that you can use to generate as many models as you want.

```ts
// an array of 10 users
seed.users((x) => x(10));

// an array of 10 users with a custom email
seed.users((x) => x(10, {
  email: (ctx) => copycat.email(ctx.seed, { domain: 'snaplet.dev' })
}));

// an array of 10 users with a custom email depending on contextual informations
seed.users((x) => x(10, (ctx) => ({
  email: `user${ctx.index}@snaplet.dev`,
})));
```

And if you need both static and dynamic data, you can mix them together!

```ts
// an array of 10 users
seed.users((x) => [
  { email: 'first@acme.com' },
  ...x(8),
  { email: 'last@acme.com' },
])
```

#### Using the generate callback

If you need more control over the value generated for each field, you can also pass a function for that field:

```ts
seed.users([{
  email: (ctx) => copycat.email(ctx.seed)
}])
```

##### `seed`

A value unique to a particular field, and to a particular model being generated.

`seed` is deterministic in the sense that for each new _session_ (for example, each new run of a seed script using `@snaplet/seed`, or each
new run of the same [`$transaction`](#client-state)), the generate
callback will receive the same value for `seed` for the same field of the same model.

```ts
const run = () =>
  seed.$transaction(async (seed) => {
    await seed.customers([
      {
        email: (ctx) => copycat.email(ctx.seed),
      },
    ]);
  });

await run();
// INSERT INTO public."Customer" ... VALUES (..., 'Autumn_Boyer64366@vague-foal.org', ...);

await run();
// INSERT INTO public."Customer" ... VALUES (..., 'Autumn_Boyer64366@vague-foal.org', ...);
```

You can also access the `seed` of a model by using a callback.

```ts
await seed.customers([
  (ctx) => {
    const createdAt = copycat.dateString(ctx.seed);
    const day = 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000;
    const updatedAt = new date(createdAt.getTime() + day);
    return {
      createdAt,
      updatedAt,
    };
  }
]);
```

##### `data`

An object containing the data already generated for a particular model.

```ts
await seed.users([{
  email: (ctx) => `${ctx.data.first_name}${ctx.data.last_name}@example.org`.toLowerCase()
}])
```

###### Field precedence

The place in which the generate callback was given will determine what fields will be already available in `data`.

For example, fields specified earlier in the same object for a particular model will be available in `data` for fields
specified later in that object:

```ts
await seed.users([{
  // `name` is evaluated first, then `email`
  name: (ctx) => copycat.firstName(ctx.seed),
  email: (ctx) => `${ctx.data.name}@example.org`.toLowerCase()
}])
```

And similarly, fields specified for a model when creating a new `SeedClient` (`name` in the example below) will be available in `data` for
fields specified as part of a plan (`email` in the example below):

```ts
await createSeedClient({
  models: {
    users: {
      name: (ctx) => copycat.firstName(ctx.seed)
    }
  }
})

await seed.users([{
  // `name` was given when creating `SeedClient`, so it'll be available here
  email: (ctx) => `${ctx.data.name}@example.org`.toLowerCase()
}])
```

To help with knowing what exactly will be available in `data`, we generate data in this order:

1. Values for parent relation fields  (for example, an `organizationId` field on a `members`  model) will be generated first

2. Then default values for fields (if you didn't explicitly define what the value of a field should be anywhere) will be generated next

3. Then values given for fields using the `models` option for `createSeedClient` (as shown below) will be generated next:

 ```ts
await createSeedClient({
  models: {
    users: {
      name: (ctx) => copycat.firstName(ctx.seed)
    }
  }
})
```

4. Then values given for fields using the `models` option for a plan:

```ts
seed.users([{ ... }], {
  models: {
    name: (ctx) => copycat.firstName(ctx.seed)
  }
})
```

5. Then finally, fields specified earlier in the same object for a particular model will be generated before fields specified later in that object:

```ts
await seed.users([{
  // `name` is evaluated first, then `email`
  name: (ctx) => copycat.firstName(ctx.seed),
  email: (ctx) => `${ctx.data.name}@example.org`.toLowerCase()
}])
```

##### `store`

The [store local to this plan](#local-stores), containing models already created in this plan.

##### `$store`

The [global store](https://docs.snaplet.dev/core-concepts/seed#the-global-store) containing all models created in this `snaplet` instance so far.

### Connecting data

#### Using the `connect` option

We provide a special option that you can activate in the options of a plan, called `connect`.

When `true`, the plan will automatically connect models relationships to fulfill to the client's global store if possible. The corresponding model will be picked randomly (but deterministically, we're using `copycat.oneOf` function under the hood).

In the following example, the `post` model will be connected to one of the 3 `users` in the store.

```ts
await seed.users((x) => x(3));
// mark
await seed.posts([{}], { connect: true });
```

You can also provide a store to the `connect` option, in which case the plan will connect to the models in the store instead of the client's global store.

```ts
await seed.users((x) => x(3));

const heroesStore = await seed.users([
  { email: 'bruce@wayne-enterprises.com' },
  { email: 'peter.parker@gmail.com' }
]);

await seed.posts([{}], { connect: heroesStore });
```

In the above case, the `post` model will be connected to one of the user in the `heroesStore`.

The store can also be manually constructed, for example if you want to connect to existing records in your database.

```ts
const users = await prisma.users.findMany({
  where: { status: 'HERO' }
})

await seed.posts([{}], { connect: { users } });
```

#### Using the `connect` function

If you need a more fine-grained control over the connection, you can use the `connect` function injected into the model callback API.

<CH.Scrollycoding className="seed-tutorial-configuration-file">

Let's start from our previous plan.

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

const seed = await createSeedClient();

await seed.posts([{
  title: 'Hello World!',
  author: {
    email: (ctx) =>
      copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
        domain: 'acme.org',
      }),
  },
  comments: (x) => x(3),
}]);
```

---

We specify that the author of each comment will be provided from an external source rather than being generated using the model callback API.

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

const seed = await createSeedClient()

await seed.posts([{
  title: 'Hello World!',
  author: {
    email: (ctx) =>
      copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
        domain: 'acme.org',
      }),
  },
  comments: (x) => x(3, {
    // focus
    author: () => {}
  }),
}]);
```

---

We can use the `connect` function injected in the context to express that the author of the comments is the same as the post.
We are using the plan's internal `store` to fetch the generated user.
In this case the only generated `user` in the plan will be the author of the post.

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

await seed.posts([{
  title: 'Hello World!',
  author: {
    email: (ctx) =>
      copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
        domain: 'acme.org',
      }),
  },
  comments: (x) => x(3, {
    // focus(1:3)
    author: (ctx) => ctx.connect(
      ({ store }) => store.users[0]
    )
  }),
}]);
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

##### `store`

The [store local to this plan](#local-stores), containing models already created in this plan.

##### `$store`

The [global store](https://docs.snaplet.dev/core-concepts/seed#the-global-store) containing all models created in this `snaplet` instance so far.

## Customizing `@snaplet/seed` with aliases

The models, fields and relationships names are fully customizable. You can use the `alias` option to change them.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You need to regenerate your types after changing the alias option.

  To do that, run this command in your terminal:
  ```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
  npx @snaplet/seed sync
  ```
</Callout>

### Inflection

Inflection generally refers to the modification of words to express different grammatical categories.
In our context, inflection is about altering the form of a model, field or relationship name to fit its intended use or to adhere to certain conventions so your code is more readable.

You can use the `inflection` option to provide your own rules to define the names of your models, fields and relationships.

We provide a default and sensible implementation of the inflection rules, inspired by [PostGraphile](https://github.com/graphile/pg-simplify-inflector#graphile-contribpg-simplify-inflector), but you can override them if you want.

These rules are:

- **Model names:** pluralized and camelCased.
- **Scalar field names:** camelCased.
- **Parent field names (one to one relationships):** singularized and camelCased.
- **Child field names (one to many relationships):** pluralized and camelCased.
- We also support [prefix extraction and opposite baseName for foreign keys](https://github.com/graphile/pg-simplify-inflector#naming-your-foreign-key-fields).

Given your tables being named `User`, `Post` and `Comment`, here is an example of how the default `inflection` strategy is applied to change the names of your models:

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient()

// without inflection, you would have to use seed.User(...)
await seed.users((x) => x(3))
```

And here is how you would change the inflection rules:

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  seed: {
    alias: {
      inflection: {
        modelName: (modelName) => `Super${modelName}s`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient()

// without inflection, you would have to use seed.User(...)
await seed.SuperUsers((x) => x(3))
```

If you don't want to use the `inflection` feature, you can disable it by setting `inflection: false` in the `alias` option.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  seed: {
    alias: {
      inflection: false,
    },
  }
});
```

### Override

If you are not satisfied with the default names of your models, fields or relationships, but you only want to do one-off changes, you can use the `override` option.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  seed: {
    alias: {
      override: {
        User: {
          fields: {
            Post_Post_validator_idToUser: 'validatedPosts',
          }
        }
      }
    },
  },
});
```

```ts seed.mts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient()

await seed.users([{
  // without override, it would be: postsByValidatorId: [...]
  validatedPosts: [{ title: 'Hello World!' }]
}])
```

The `override` option is applied on top of the `inflection` option, it's perfect for one-off changes.
Generated data, or seed data, is a useful tool in software development,
