**Seed** is a set of tools **understanding your database schema** to help you **generate production-accurate data**.

It consists of the following parts:

- **Seed ORM**: Auto-generated and type-safe data client for Node.js & TypeScript 🛡️
- **Seed CLI**: A CLI to generate and keep the data client in sync with your database 🛠️
- **Seed AI**: Our custom model identifying the shape of your data 🤖

We are compatible with [PostgreSQL](../reference/adapters#postgresql) and [SQLite](../reference/adapters#sqlite). MySQL support is coming soon.

## Seed ORM

Our data client is auto-generated from your database schema.
We are using the full power of TypeScript to provide you with a type-safe and auto-completed experience when working with your data.

You can focus on the data that matter to **you**, we will take care of generating all the relationships. ✨

Here is a sneak peek of what you can do with Seed ORM:

Are you working on a blog app and need 5 posts?
```ts
await seed.posts((x) => x(5))
```

Or maybe you need a user with a specific email?
```ts
await seed.users([
  { email: 'snappy@snaplet.dev' },
])
```

What if you want to create an organization with a varying number of members?
```ts
await seed.organizations([
  {
    name: 'Snaplet',
    members: (x) => x({ min: 1, max: 10 }),
  },
])
```

And this is just the beginning! Explore the [Seed ORM guide]() to see all the possibilities.

## Seed CLI

The CLI is the entry point to Seed. It will help you generate the data client and keep it in sync with your database.

To begin your journey with Seed in seconds, run this command in your project directory:
```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed init
```

Checkout the [Seed CLI reference]() to learn more about the CLI and how to use it.
