# Installation

## For generating seed data

First, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed on your system.

Once you have these, installation should be as simple as running this following in your command line:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
# Set up Snaplet with npx
npx snaplet setup
```

Snaplet will ask you a few questions to set up snaplet for your project. Along the way, it tries to detect the package manager used for your project and uses this
to download the snaplet npm packages needed for your project.

## Manual setup

### Installing dependencies

Snaplet requires the following dependencies to be present in your project:
* a `package.json`: to determine where to install snaplet packages to
* a package manager lockfile to be present for your project - to detect which package manager you are using

If you do not have a `package.json`, you can add one to your project with:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npm init -y
```

We look for a package manager lockfile for npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun. If you do not have a lockfile for your project, or you are using a different package manager, you can still install snaplet npm packages manually:

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
  npm install --save-dev snaplet @snaplet/seed
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
  pnpm add --save-dev snaplet @snaplet/seed
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
  yarn add --dev snaplet @snaplet/seed
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
  bun add --dev snaplet @snaplet/seed
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Generating @snaplet/seed assets

Once `@snaplet/seed` has been installed as a dependency, we still need to generate the assets that `@snaplet/seed` uses - snaplet looks at your database and generates a library that corresponds to your database structure.

If you are familiar with [`@prisma/client`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client), you can think of `snaplet generate` doing the same thing, just in this case for `@snaplet/seed` rather than `@prisma/client`.

This can be done by running:

```
npx snaplet generate
```
